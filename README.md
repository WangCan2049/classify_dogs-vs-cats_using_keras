# classify_dogs-vs-cats_using_keras

Here, we use Keras, an high level neural network Library for classify Dog vs cat images from kaggle data-set.
For more description :- https://medium.com/@parthvadhadiya424/hello-world-program-in-keras-with-cnn-dog-vs-cat-classification-efc6f0da3cc5



## Prerequisites
use conda to install dependencies.

```
conda install tensorflow-gpu keras opencv pillow numpy
```


## Usage

Untitled.ipynb contains hello world program in keras(simpler example)

firstly download data-set from :- https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/data

python3 pre.py responsible for preprocessing of data-set

python3 model.py is for build and train model.

python3 use_model.py use for predict new images.

if you dont want to train just run python3 use_model.py . you will get output with my pretrained model.
